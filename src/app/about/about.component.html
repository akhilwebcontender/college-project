      <h5 class="card-title">Mobile App Development</h5>
      <p class="card-text">  Mobile application development is the set of processes and procedures involved in writing software for small, wireless computing devices. Like Web application development, mobile application development has its roots in more traditional software development. One critical difference, however, is that mobile apps are often written specifically to take advantage of the unique features a particular mobile device offers. For instance, a gaming app might be written to take advantage of the iPhone's accelerometer or a mobile health app might be written to take advantage of a smartwatch's temperature sensor.</p>
